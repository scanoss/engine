*@brief Main match/component "objects" definitions. As is know C languaje does not have "objects", but we are going to use
* this word since the code is organized like a 	class.
*#Introduction
* Version 5 of the engine is based in a deep refactoring, changing the match selection process and component filling, from
* statics structures to dynamic linked list. In this new organization three objects are cleary defined:
* -SCAN: is defined by "scan_data_t" and contains the properties and methods related the file being scanned.
* -MATCH: is definned by "match_data_t" and contains properties and methods related with the match "matching" with the scanned file.
* -COMPONENT: is definned by "match_data_t" and contains properties and methods related with the open source component of a match.
*
* When the engine process a scan, this is search matches for a wfp, the result can be one, many, or none matches depending the case.
* So, the first step is define the type of scan and in consequence of its match (match_t).
*-Full file match: the md5 of the file was found in the KB. There is only one possible match.
*-Snippet match: the md5 was not found in the KB. May be multiples file matching against differents snippets in the scanned file.
*-None: the snippet scan finish without results.
*
*One determined the possible matches, the engine has to determinate the right open source component for each one. It is very common
*have more than one valid posibility. In that case the engine will select as best component the oldest. Also it is possible request
*the engine for more than one component per match.
*
*#Nested linked list
*As was said in the previous introduction, a SCAN can have multiple matches and a MATCH can have multiple components.
*Moreover, the number of matches or components will change depending what we are scanning. So, linked list will supply
*the needed flexibility and also is a efficient method to keep the information sorted.
